# Orientation Course - Basics of JavaScript Programming

MP 9/2020

## JavaScript assignment 2

Make an application that simulates a [Rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game.

- Start with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWPtKtYEsN4)
- Download the png image files from Oma
- This time it's ok to modify html and css freely to style your game

- Video tutorial at 30:15: use a for-of loop instead of `array.forEach()` (the modern way)
  - you can use the arrow function syntax for event handler functions, just use the name of the variable instead of `this`, example:

  ```js
  for (const option of options) {
    option.addEventListener("click", () => {
      // option refers to current item, no need for 'this'
      console.log(option);
    });
  }
  ```

  - same syntax works with `animationend` events too

**NOTE:** This is an individual assignment, not a group assignment.

### Functional requirements

- all the functionalities implemented in the tutorial
- choose and implement at least two features of the following:

  1. game ends after 10 wins for a player or computer (similar idea is described in the end of the video tutorial)
      - show a message telling who won the whole game
  1. game ends if a player or computer wins 3 times in a row
      - an idea: use an array to record wins/results and check after every round if the three latest items match
  1. user interface enhancements
      - buttons are [disabled](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_pushbutton_disabled.asp) while hands are shaking
      - use rock image for all handshake animations
  1. add a game over screen
      - check features 1. & 2.
      - display winner info after the whole game ends
      - hide hand images and option buttons
      - you can use the game start screen as a reference
  1. add a "Play again" button to game over screen
      - button click starts the game again
      - resets all win history

### Returning

- Check instructions in Oma assignments
- upload the application to your _public_html/_ and return working a web link to Oma
- describe all the functionalities you implemented to Oma
- return all files to Oma in a ZIP file

### Grading

0-5 points.

- working application based on the tutorial with some custom styling: 2 points
- chosen functional requirements implemented: +3 points
- EXTRA: design and implement an extra feature to you app + 0-1 point
  - explain the idea of the feature when returning assignment to Oma
- Messy code, hard to read and understand, comments mssing, etc.: minus points
- Returned after deadline to Oma: 1-5 minus points (more than a week late -> don't bother anymore)
